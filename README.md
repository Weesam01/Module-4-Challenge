# Module-4-Challenge

In this repository you will find a .ipynb file named Whale Analysis,
in this file we will prepare CSV data files for analysis,
we will conduct Quantitative Analysis between the data files and S&P TSX 60 

# Risk Analysis
We will then Perform Risk analysis for set data and box plot for each data,
calculate the standard deviation for each portfolio,
determine which portfolios are riskier than the S&P TSX 60,
and lastly calculate the Annualized Standard Deviation

# Rolling Statistics
We will then Perform Rolling Statistics,
we will calculate and plot the rolling standard deviation for all portfolios using a 21-day window,
calculate and plot the correlation between each stock to determine which portfolios may mimick the S&P TSX 60,
finally we will chose one portfolio to calculate and plot the 60-day rolling beta for it and the S&P TSX 60.

# Sharpe Ratios 
We will then perform Sharpe Ratios calculations
Using the daily returns, we will calculate and visualize the Sharpe ratios using a bar plot
Then determine whether the algorithmic strategies outperform the market (S&P TSX 60) and the whales portfolios.

# Custom Portfolio 
We will then create a Custom Portfolio

We will download the data as CSV files and calculate the portfolio returns
Calculate the weighted returns of said portfolio, assuming equal number of shares per stock.
Add my portfolio returns to the DataFrame with the other portfolios.
We will also run the following analyses:
Calculate the Annualized Standard Deviation.
Calculate and plot rolling std with a 21-day window.
Calculate and plot the correlation.
Calculate and plot the 60-day rolling beta for your portfolio compared to the S&P 60 TSX.
Calculate the Sharpe ratios and generate a bar plot.
